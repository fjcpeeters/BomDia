# BomDia.m

The BomDia.m algorithm v3.0 is associated to:

Peeters, F.J.C., van der Lubbe, H.J.L. and P. Scussolini (under review). Age-depth models for tropical marine hemipelagic deposits improve significantly when proxy-based information on sediment composition is included. Submitted to Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology on 2022-05-03.

The BomDia algorithm produces optimal age-models for marine hemi-pelagic sediment cores. The present version 3.0 includes age model uncertatinty estimation using a Monte-Carlo approach. The algorithm requires input of Age Control Points and their uncertainty as wel as downcore data on the calcium carbonate content. For graphical output the MatLab script "fanChart.m" is required, which can be downloaded from the Mathworks.com. It is recommended to run the model using 500,000 simulations and a selection of 30 for best age models.
