# BomDia.m

The BomDia.m algorithm version3.0 is associated to:

F. J.C. Peeters, H.J.L. van der Lubbe and P. Scussolini (under review). Age-depth models for tropical marine hemipelagic deposits improve significantly when proxy-based information on sediment composition is included. Submitted to Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology.

The BomDia algorithm produces age-models for marine hemi-pelagic sediment cores and requires input of Age Control Points and uncertainty as wel as downcore data on the calcium carbonate content. The present version includes age model uncertatinty estimation using a Monte-Carlo approach.

It is recommended to run the model using 500,000 simulations and a selection of 30 for best age models.
